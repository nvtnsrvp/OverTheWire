# Hexdumps are used to examine data that cannot be represented as strings by displaying it in hexadecimal format.
# A hexdump has three main columns.
# 1) address 2) hex representation of the data on that address 3) actual data as strings `.` = hex values that cannot be represented as a string
# 00000000: 1f8b 0808 dfcd eb66 0203 6461 7461 322e  .......f..data2.
# xxd <input_file> <output_file> creates hexdumps
