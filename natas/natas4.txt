# An HTTP request typically includes the method (GET, POST, etc.), URL, and protocol version.
# It may also contain headers, such as "Authorization" (credentials) and "Referer" (originating URL), which provide additional information.

# The HTTP Referer header tells the server the URL of the page that linked to or requested the current resource.
# It identifies where a user came from or where a resource is being used.
